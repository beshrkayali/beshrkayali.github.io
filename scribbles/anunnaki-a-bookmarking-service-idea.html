I've always been interested in working on a project that tries to solve a possible problem. To me, bookmarking is one of the things that has always seemed to be lacking. It's like it got stuck in time and all the big guys are scared of touching it.
</p>
<p>
For the past couple of months, I've been working on a solution that tries to solve some of the problems that I think exist with currently available bookmarking services:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Asking the user to enter details that -to me- aren't always necessary: Titles, descriptions, and tags are things that a system can (and should) figure out on its own without hassling the user with having to enter them (or even approve them before saving) every time a bookmark is saved.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The fact that these services require taking a specific action for bookmarking is particularly frustrating as sometimes users might forget to bookmark certain web pages. Another thing is that users might not know when they need to bookmark something when they first see it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To search bookmarks users have to go to the website of the service they're using and then search, which is a bit excessive I think. I find myself searching Google when I'm trying to find something I have bookmarked before, because it's faster and much easier to access. Changing the default search engine hampers the user's work flow.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are just some of the things that bothered me with bookmarking over the years, and that led me to start a new project (calling it Anunnaki for now). I'm glad to announce the alpha version in this post.
</p>
<p>
Below you can find all the information that I have about Anunnaki so far. I'm also looking for testers who are willing to try it for a while. I would love to get your feedback on how it works and if it's useful for you as it's useful for me (and 40 other alpha testers using it now).
Key Features
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Passive Bookmarking:</strong> Automatic bookmarking based on configurable variables: time-period and/or scroll-position.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Search Engine Integration:</strong> Search results from bookmarks embedded inside Google's search results page (and later on, Bing).
</li>
<li>
Gmail-like dashboard with keyboard shortcuts, wide-screenshots, automatically generated tags, and filter options allowing users to drill down and browse their bookmarks.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find a more detailed list of features here: http://anunnaki.me/features/.
